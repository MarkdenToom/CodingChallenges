# countdown.py - A simple countdown script.

"""At a high level, hereâ€™s what your program will do:
1. Count down from 5.
2. Play a sound file (alarm.wav) when the countdown reaches zero.

This means your code will need to do the following:
1. Pause for 1 second in between displaying each number in the countdown by calling time.sleep().
2. Call subprocess.Popen() to open the sound file with the default application."""

import time

timeLeft = 5
while timeLeft > 0:
    print(timeLeft, end='')
    time.sleep(1)
    timeLeft = timeLeft - 1

# At the end of the countdown, play a sound file.
subprocess.Popen(['start', 'alarm.wav'], shell=True)
